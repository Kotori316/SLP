# Scala language provider for Minecraft 1.17.1.

Branch 1.17

This mod adds Scala library to Minecraft 1.17.1 with Forge.
**NO COMPATIBILITY WITH 1.16.5 version of SLP.**
Seems to work in both 1.17 and 1.18.

## Usage

* For Player - Download Jar file from [Curse Forge][curse_forge] and move the file to your `mods` folder. This mod will
  not appear in mods list.

* For Developer  
  See [this repository](https://github.com/Kotori316/SLP-example) for example.

  In your `build.gradle`, add below code in the top-level.

  ```groovy
  repositories {
      maven {
          name = "Azure-SLP"
          url = uri("https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/Kotori316/minecraft/_packaging/mods/maven/v1")
          content {
              it.includeModule("com.kotori316", "ScalableCatsForce".toLowerCase())
              it.includeModule("org.typelevel", "cats-core_2.13")
              it.includeModule("org.typelevel", "cats-kernel_2.13")
          }
      }
  }

  dependencies {
      def scala_version = getProperty("scala_version")
      def scala_major = getProperty("scala_major")
      // Change forge and minecraft version.
      minecraft 'net.minecraftforge:forge:1.17.1-37.0.0'
      compileOnly(group: 'org.scala-lang', name: 'scala-library', version: scala_version)
      // Add if you need this library. I use a modified version of Cats to avoid some module errors.
      compileOnly(group: 'org.typelevel', name: "cats-core_${scala_major}", version: '2.8.0-kotori')

      // The language loader. You can put the jar to the mods dir instead of declaring in `build.gradle`.
      // This file is needed as the scala library will not be loaded in dev environment due to change of classpath by Forge.
      runtimeOnly(group: "com.kotori316", name: "ScalableCatsForce".toLowerCase(), version: "2.13.8-build-1", classifier: "with-library") {
          transitive(false)
      }
  }
  ```

  * **If the Minecraft client doesn't launch with an exception to modules, change scala dependency from "implementation"
    to "compileOnly" and add slp mod in mods directory.**
  * Properties are set in your `gradle.properties` file or just hardcoded like `def scala_version = "2.13.8"`.
  * `scala_version` should be 2.13.8 because this project contains binary of Scala 2.13.8. Make sure your version
    matches the version this mod provides. See [this file](https://github.com/Kotori316/SLP/blob/1.17/gradle.properties)
  * `scala_major` must be 2.13.
    * Currently, Scala3 is not supported.

### Limitations

In this section, I note some points you should care.

1. Avoid use of `Mod.EventBusSubscriber` in Java code. This will cause exception in "compileScala" task.
   * Use in Scala code will not throw exception.
2. ~Avoid use of record, which is introduced in Java 14.~
  This will be fixed in 2.13.7. https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/11908
  * Fixed in 2.13.7
3. Use gradlew to run client.
  * To avoid `java.lang.module.ResolutionException`.
  * You can still use run configuration generated by gradle task after setting "ignoreList" in VM option.
4. If you got compile error "ambiguous reference to overloaded definition", specify the return type.
  * For example, `val offsetPos = pos.relative(direction)` will cause this error because `relative` is declared both in `BlockPos` and `Vec3i`, and the return types aren't same. So, the compiler can't determine which method to call. To resolve this issue, specify the return type as follows. `val offsetPos: BlockPos = pos.relative(direction)`
5. No support of Scala3 until 2.13.8 is used in Scala3
   * Currently, 2.13.6 is used, so record can't be used.

## API
* [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/scala/scala) - is licenced under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.scala-lang.org/license/).
* [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) - is licenced under the [Licence](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/master/COPYING).
  * SLP uses [modified version of Cats](https://github.com/Kotori316/cats) to avoid module error.
